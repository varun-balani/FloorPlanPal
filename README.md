# Sundial

This project enables users to visualize the direction of the sun at different times of the day on a floorplan. By leveraging geographical location and time, the application calculates and displays the sun's position relative to the floorplan, allowing users to understand how sunlight interacts with their space throughout the day, and make adjustments to their floorplan accordingly.
